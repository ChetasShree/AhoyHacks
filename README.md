The newly crowned Pirate King, Monkey D. Luffy has set sail in the world to conquer the 4 seas. He sails now towards the grand line to steal the one piece. For non pirates *(Hackers)* we need to find the safest route through the seas to get to our destination wwithout being attacked by their fearsome crew.
